# tiling-rhytmic-canons

This repository contains the scripts Python for the computational tests of the paper "A SAT Encoding to Compute Aperiodic Tiling Rhythmic Canons"
The script ILP_canons.py is the Integer Programming Model implemented in the paper, the script SAT_canons.py contains the SAT Encoding for the same model using as PySat. The Sat 
Solver used is MapleSat.
